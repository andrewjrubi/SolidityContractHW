# SolidityContractHW

### This project includes three smart contracts that are used to split profits or company shares, deployed on the Ropsten test network. 

#### AssociateProfitSplitter distributes profits evenly among three employees.
#### TieredProfitSplitter distributes profits via a predetermined percentage (in this case based on position within the company, ie CEO, CTO and Bob, a random employee).
#### DeferredEquityPlan is a deferred equity incentive plan that awards 1,000 company shares over a four year period (250 shares awarded every 365 days).

### The following testnet addresses are used for the contracts:
#### Ropsten Testnet address: 0xd7541c212ea2DEC49FF3081D49fE452b1a69db75
#### Employee_one/CEO: 0xA6CC7F2ecD4Fa9B8d8B59e5eDaB33B6016b4322f
